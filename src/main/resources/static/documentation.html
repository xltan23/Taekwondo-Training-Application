                Dropdown options allow users to select specific number of duration/repetition per set.
                Each specific duration/repetition has a score tied to it and scores may not necessarily
                be proportionate to the number. Higher end number or intensity yield exponentially higher 
                scores thereby making it more rewarding to perform those for shorter workout sessions.
                In the example above, 10 just means 10s or 10 reps. 12/S means 12 per side (On each leg).
                XX-XX is usually indicative of a package drill. 20-15 may mean 20 reps of kick and 15s hold.
                1/5 mass means the weights used is 1/5 of the user's body mass. If workout requires only two 
                weights (eg. chest press), 1/5 mass is the mass of each weights.
